# Foursquare-Clone-Parse-MapKit

This is a foursquare clone app which users can log in, log out, save the places with title, comment, and location. They can see their saved places as a list. When they click the saved places, the information regarding the places can be visible. I used Parse as a back-end server in this app. The operations regarding the users, such as user sign in, sign up and log out, were applied with Parse. Besides, I benefited from MapKit so that the users can select places and view them later. To be more precise, the users can pin the places and save them to the app. In that regard, all data were saved in Parse back-end server.
